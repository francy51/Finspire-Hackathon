A set of charting components from [Chartkick](https://chartkick.com/react)

Currently a work in progress. In order to add your own data sets, you'll need to copy the code from a chart component, and replace the `data` property with the data set you'd like. Data can be accepted either as an array or as an object.

Array: `[ ["Item 1", 1], ["Item 2", 2] ]`
Object: `{ "Item 1": 1, "Item 2": 2 }`

Includes:

- Area Chart
- Bar Chart
- Column Chart
- Line Chart
- Pie Chart
- Scatter Chart

---

Todo:

- Add custom color support
- Add JSON support

Thanks to Max Bredow for the help and getting this started!
